# CozmoEnvironmentExploration
This repository contains code for a breadth-first search based intelligent environment exploration algorithm for the Anki Cozmo robot. It was created as a term project for CMU 15-494.
In order to run the environment exloration, go in to the folder entitled final project, then generate and run the GraphExplore fsm file. Make sure you have simple_cli, cozmo tools and cozmo_fsm installed/available. If you are working on a computer that is already fully set up for Cozmo, you should be able to run GraphExplore.fsm outside of the final project folder (thus why it is included on its own.
Cozmo_tools and the Cozmo fsm were created by David Touretsky
